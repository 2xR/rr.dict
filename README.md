# rr.dict

Utility functions for working with dictionaries. Defines very useful `merge()` and `diff()` 
operations, as well as other utilities like `extract()` to create new dicts containing a subset of 
the original dict, and `lookup()` to attempt multiple keys before raising an exception.

There is also a `rr.dict.nested` module containing functions to create, manipulate and iterate over 
nested dictionaries.

## Installation

For now only available directly from the Git repo:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/2xR/rr.dict.git
